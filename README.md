This code is basically a voice-activated virtual assistant named Zora, which listens for a wake word ("hello") and then processes spoken commands to perform tasks like telling the time, opening Notepad, or searching the web.

I’ll break it down section by section:

**1. Libraries Used**
import speech_recognition as sr  # Converts speech to text
import pyttsx3                   # Converts text to speech
import datetime                  # Handles date and time
import webbrowser                # Opens websites
import os                        # Interacts with OS to open apps
import time                      # For delays (reminders)
import threading                 # Runs tasks in parallel
**2. Initialization**
speech_recognizer = sr.Recognizer()   # Recognizer object for capturing audio
text_to_speech_engine = pyttsx3.init()  # Engine for speaking responses
speech_lock = threading.Lock()  # Lock to prevent overlapping speech
**3. Text-to-Speech Function**
def convert_text_to_speech(text):
    with speech_lock:  # Ensures only one speech output at a time
        text_to_speech_engine.say(text)
        text_to_speech_engine.runAndWait()
This converts text into spoken audio.

speech_lock prevents two threads from speaking over each other.

**4. Speech-to-Text Function**
def capture_audio():
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        speech_recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)  # Adjust to background noise
        audio = speech_recognizer.listen(source)  # Record speech

        try:
            print("Recognizing...")
            recognized_text = speech_recognizer.recognize_google(audio)  # Google API
            print(f"You said: {recognized_text}")
            return recognized_text.lower()
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            convert_text_to_speech("Sorry, I did not understand that. Can you please repeat?")
        except sr.RequestError:
            convert_text_to_speech("Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to the speech service.")
Records the user's voice.

Sends it to Google’s speech recognition service.

Handles unknown speech and connection issues.

**5. Wake Word Listener**
def wait_for_activation_word():
    while True:
        print("Say 'hello' to activate...")
        recognized_command = capture_audio()
        if recognized_command and "hello" in recognized_command:
            convert_text_to_speech("Yes, I'm listening")
            break
Keeps listening until the user says "hello".

Then activates the assistant.

**6. Command Processor**
def process_command(command):
    if "hello" in command:
        greet_user()
    elif "your name" in command:
        convert_text_to_speech("I am Zora,,,your virtual assistant.")
    elif "time" in command:
        threading.Thread(target=provide_current_time).start()
    elif "date" in command:
        threading.Thread(target=provide_current_date).start()
    elif "open notepad" in command:
        threading.Thread(target=open_notepad_application).start()
    elif "search for" in command:
        threading.Thread(target=perform_web_search, args=(command,)).start()
    elif "remind me to" in command:
        threading.Thread(target=create_reminder, args=(command,)).start()
    elif "exit" in command or "stop" in command:
        convert_text_to_speech("Goodbye!")
        return False
    else:
        ask_for_clarification()
    return True
Matches the spoken command to an action.

Uses threads so Zora can keep listening while doing tasks.

Returns False when the user says "exit" or "stop" (to end the loop).

**7. Task Functions**
Each of these functions does one thing:

Greet user
def greet_user():
    convert_text_to_speech("Hello! i am Zora, How can I assist you today?")
Tell time
def provide_current_time():
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%I:%M %p")
    convert_text_to_speech(f"The current time is {current_time}")
Tell date
def provide_current_date():
    current_date = datetime.date.today().strftime("%B %d, %Y")
    convert_text_to_speech(f"Today's date is {current_date}")
Open Notepad
def open_notepad_application():
    os.startfile("notepad.exe")
    convert_text_to_speech("Opening Notepad")
Web search
def perform_web_search(command):
    query = command.replace("search for", "").strip()
    webbrowser.open(f"https://www.google.com/search?q={query}")
    convert_text_to_speech(f"Here are the results for {query}")
Reminder
def create_reminder(command):
    reminder_text = command.replace("remind me to", "").strip()
    convert_text_to_speech(f"Setting a reminder for: {reminder_text}")
    threading.Thread(target=delay_reminder, args=(reminder_text,)).start()

def delay_reminder(reminder_text):
    time.sleep(10)  # Wait 10 seconds for demo
    convert_text_to_speech(f"Reminder: {reminder_text}")
Ask for clarification


def ask_for_clarification():
    convert_text_to_speech("I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Can you please clarify what you need?")
**8. Main Assistant Loop**

def run_virtual_assistant():
    while True:
        wait_for_activation_word()  # Wait for "hello"
        while True:
            command = capture_audio()
            if command:
                if not process_command(command):
                    break
Outer loop: Waits for the wake word "hello".

Inner loop: Keeps listening for commands until the user says "exit".

**9. Program Entry**

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_virtual_assistant()
Starts the assistant when the file is run.
